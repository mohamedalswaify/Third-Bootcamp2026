---------------------------------------------------------
-- 📘 THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION: What is DQL?
------------------------------------------------------------
-- DQL (Data Query Language) is used to fetch data from database objects such as tables and views.
-- The main DQL command is:
--     SELECT

-- 🔹 SQL SELECT SYNTAX:
-- SELECT * |  column1, column2, ...
-- FROM table_name
-- [WHERE condition]
-- [ORDER BY column1, column2, ... [ASC|DESC]]



 🔹 Operators:
--   ➕ Arithmetic: +, -, *, /
--   🔁 Comparison: =, !=, <>, <, <=, >, >=
--   🧮 Range: BETWEEN ... AND ...



-- 🧠 This course demonstrates how to use SELECT in practical contexts, from basic retrieval to advanced logic and multi-table operations.
